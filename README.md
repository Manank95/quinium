## HackNYU 2018 Project

This app is currently being worked on and is top-secret. We are unable to publicly release information at this time but will aim for a public launch date of March 25th, 2018. Thank you for your interest and we hope you can find some Red Bull to fuel your day.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) - 3.6 (Because 2.7 is dying)
* [Keras](https://keras.io) - Easier than TensorFlow
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) - Unfortunately, we ended up having to use it
* [Julia](https://julialang.org) - Better than Python
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com) - We must use node.js
